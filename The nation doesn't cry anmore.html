					* Use class "ph-full" to enable fullscreen size.
					* Use class "ph-cap-sm", "ph-cap-lg", "ph-cap-xlg" or "ph-cap-xxlg" to set caption size (no class = default size).
					* Use class "ph-center" to enable content center position.
					* Use class "ph-bg-image" to enable page header background image (required for a portfolio single project!).
					* Use class "ph-bg-image-is-light" if needed, it makes the elements dark and more visible if you use a very light image (effect only with class "ph-bg-image").
					* Use class "ph-image-shadow" to enable page header background image (effect only with class "ph-bg-image").
					* Use class "ph-image-cropped" to crop image. It fixes image dimensions (no effect for "ph-bg-image"!).
					* Use class "ph-image-cover-*" to set image overlay opacity. For example "ph-image-cover-2" or "ph-image-cover-2-5" (up to "ph-image-cover-9-5").
					* Use class "ph-content-parallax" to enable content parallax.
					* Use class "ph-stroke" to enable caption title stroke style.

									<!-- Begin blog post content -->
									<div class="tt-blog-post-content">
									<p>The nation doesn’t cry anymore. She has no tears left to shed now. All she has currently is a
										cheek left dry from the frequent factitious wiping away of the pools of water that collect in her
										eyelids as she sees the state she has now been degraded to. She still allows the men walking on
										her yet habitable lands to talk about her glorious past with much grandeur as they continue to
										catalyse her destruction and smear her once regal past in distinct hues of downfall.</p>	
									</div>

									<div class="tt-blog-post-content">
									<p>Like an expecting mother who loses her newborn to the winds of fate, she too laments over the
										broken expectations of what her child could have become. She often looks at her marvellous past
										and agonises over the shared stories of her religious anecdotes, formatively becoming seeds of
										disharmony rather than plants of hope. She always believed that the stories so culturally knit into
										her breathable fabric would become beacons of hope and togetherness in times of disharmony
										and strife. But all she hears today, as she sits bosomed by her nostalgia, are the gut-wrenching
										sounds of oppression.</p>	
									</div>	
									
									<div class="tt-blog-post-content">
									<p>The banshee in her wails for all the lives she believes will be lost if her supposed devotees do not
										mend their ways. Her shrieks speak of inherent pain, but the alleged nationalist mavens label the
										same soul-searing shrieks as songs of betterment and development. With every new case of
										lynching, they say, she edges closer and closer to discovering a new melody, a new piece of a
										renaissance. With every cow saved and every man put down, they say, she stands more and more
										near the precipice of becoming unrivalled. Ironically, her rivals themselves trumpet the alleged
										ways that can be used to make her a superpower.</p>										
									</div>

									<div class="tt-blog-post-content">
									<p>She regarded herself as a strong competitor in the race to become a superpower. However,
										currently, she is too engrossed in keeping the diverse threads of her social fabric together. She is
										highly engaged in protecting the individual lines that intermittently mingle to give her an identity
										of a multiculturally diverse nation. She weeps like a mother with a sick child, devastated yet
										hopeful. Unbeknownst to what shall happen next, she prays to those who call her their own and
										the god they fight for. She neither rings temple bells nor ties sacred threads to the walls of an
										establishment when seeking blessings. However, all she does is seek a chance to be something
										more with all her purity and zeal. Something unlike what she sees herself becoming every day.</p>	
									</div>

									<div class="tt-blog-post-content">
									<p>As her institutions lose their credibility, she wishes that there were more zealous people who
										stood by the values that she breathes for. As she sees her years-long history of sacrifice and
										blood turning to ash, she feels sorry for all the potential getting drained. With moisture in her
										eyes but no tears left to shed, she looks at the immense talent she loses as her alleged patriots
										drive the thinkers to the edge of resettlement. The brain drain happening regularly drives her
										mad, but she is declared of unsound mind every time she raises her voice. Her muffled sounds
										speak of agony, but it falls on either the deaf ears of the alleged patriots or on the scared ears of
										the general population.</p>	
									</div>

									<div class="tt-blog-post-content">
									<p>With every report concealed, she witnesses yet another truth being withheld and then becoming a
										mystery: a mystery worthy of being kept away from the light of the day. She observes as another
										fact meant to be documented slowly turns into dust. As she blows away the dust, she sees yet
										another story kept tightly packed in the yellowing paged of the binders. Though no more sealed
										cover jurisprudence shall be allowed, say the courts, she wonders how many of the aggrieved
										have time and money to fight a mighty ghost that has all the power and resources.</p>	
									</div>

									<div class="tt-blog-post-content">
									<p>At this juncture in her life, she is unsure about whether she should hold back all that she has
										repressed for a very long time or die a death worthy of a martyr after speaking her heart out. She
										still, after years of burning in inflicted misery, holds hope close to her bosom as she moves
										forward. She does so not because she has too many good incidents to hold onto but because she,
										as a nation, has grown up believing in the strength of hope.</p>

						============================ 
						* You can use padding classes if needed. For example "padding-top-xlg-150", "padding-bottom-xlg-150", "no-padding-top", "no-padding-bottom", etc. Note that each situation may be different and each section may need different classes according to your needs. More info about helper classes can be found in the file "helper.css".
